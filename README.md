# Drum-Kit-Website

This is a website created in Javascript. It consists of 7 drums and each drum has it's own unique sound. A drum sound can be played by either clicking on it or pressing a key. In the process of creating this website, I learned more about the Document Object Model (DOM) and some of the more advanced parts of Javascript.
